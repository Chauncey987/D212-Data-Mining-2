Task 1: Clustering Analysis
This task involves using clustering techniques, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering, to address a real-world organizational question. Begin by defining the question and goal, selecting a clustering method, and justifying the choice with assumptions and libraries used. Data preparation includes cleaning, identifying continuous and categorical variables, and preparing data for analysis. Perform clustering to determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluate cluster quality. Summarize the results, discuss practical implications and limitations, and recommend actions based on the analysis to address the organizational need.

Task 2: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
In this task, PCA is used to address a real-world question by reducing dimensionality and identifying the most significant components in a dataset. Define a research question and goal, and justify the use of PCA with its assumptions. Prepare the data by identifying and standardizing continuous variables, ensuring readiness for PCA. Perform PCA by calculating the principal components matrix, determining the number of components using the elbow rule or Kaiser criterion, and evaluating the variance explained by each component. Summarize the analysis, highlighting the total variance captured and the practical insights gained, and recommend actions based on the findings.

Task 3: Market Basket Analysis
This task involves performing market basket analysis to address a real-world question using the Apriori algorithm. Define the research question and goal, and explain the method with assumptions and an example of transactions. Prepare the dataset by transforming it for analysis and cleaning it as needed. Execute the Apriori algorithm to generate association rules, evaluating key metrics like support, lift, and confidence. Summarize the top three relevant rules, discuss their practical significance, and recommend actions based on the findings to support organizational decision-making.
